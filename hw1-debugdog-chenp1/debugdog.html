          Many a programmer has heard of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">Rubber Duck Debugging</a>.
          But they do not know the power of a Debug Dog. Particularly Mowgli the Debug Dog.

          As Douglas Adams once said, "One is never alone with a rubber duck." Mowgli
          the Debug Dog is far from a patient listener, but still will help you solve
          your debugging woes. Unlike a rubber duck, Mowgli is cuddly and goofy, doubling
          as your entertainment for the occasional times you need a break from your
          work (use with caution).

                <p>I remember the first time I met Mowgli. He looked so goofy as he stared at the code with me.
                I slowly explained everything and he sort of listened to my every word. The pauses were
                uncomfortable, but then I SAW it. I saw the error. Mowgli saved me hours of anguish!</p>
